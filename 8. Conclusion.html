  <p>
    This project successfully established a validated mechanical foundation for a 
    RoboMaster-compliant bipedal wheel-leg robot capable of 200&nbsp;mm step 
    climbing. Through systematic exploration of tracks, big wheels, and wheel-leg 
    architectures, the five-bar linkage big wheel-leg design proved to offer the best 
    balance of mechanical advantage, compactness, and adaptiveness to future terrain challenges.

  <p>
    Prototype testing confirmed the dynamic motion behaviour of the robot, viability of the cascaded joint, hubless 
    wheel structure, and linkage-driven actuation, providing clear insight into 
    mechanical requirements and tolerance management. These 
    results form a solid basis for the next development stage, which will focus 
    on designing a full assembly, dynamic control, balancing strategies, and software integration.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, the project demonstrates the foundation of a carefully optimised wheel-leg system 
    that could reliably overcome terrain challenges and 
    competition-ready. The design direction chosen provides a strong platform for 
    continued development toward a fully operational RoboMaster step-climbing robot.
