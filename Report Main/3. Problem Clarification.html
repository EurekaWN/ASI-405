  <h2 class="section-title">3. Problem Clarification</h2>

  <p>
    To guide the design process, a clear direction is required in the form of a
    problem clarification statement, supported by measurable criteria outlined
    in a design statement. Therefore, a competitor analysis is carried out
    first to determine the appropriate design framework to use.

  <!-- 3.1 COMPETITOR ANALYSIS -->
  <!-- ========================================================= -->
  <h3 class="subsection-title" id="sec-3-1">3.1 Competitor Analysis</h3>

  <p>
    The primary competitors in the RoboMaster University Championship (RMUC)
    are international teams, predominantly from top Chinese universities.
    Many of these teams have already developed robots with advanced
    terrain-crossing capabilities.
  </p>

  <p>
    The purpose of the competitor analysis in this project is not to simply
    replicate their designs—a strategy that has traditionally guided the NUS
    RoboMaster team—but to critically evaluate their strengths and limitations.
    By doing so, the goal is to develop a robot that surpasses existing
    solutions through better adaptability and innovative mechanical design.

  <!-- 3.2 HOW MIGHT WE DESIGN FRAMEWORK -->
  <!-- ========================================================= -->
  <h3 class="subsection-title" id="sec-3-2">3.2 How Might We Design Framework</h3>

  <p>
    The guiding question for this project is framed using the “How Might We”
    (HMW) design framework:
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>
      “How might we engineer a robot platform that can adapt to future
      RoboMaster terrain challenges, maintain efficient elevation-climbing
      capability, and incorporate innovative design strategies that maintain
      competitiveness in game for the Calibur team?”
    </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    The HMW framework is adopted because it encourages open and collaborative
    exploration of design possibilities. “How” reflects the pursuit of a better,
    future-ready robot; “Might” keeps the process flexible and open to
    unconventional solutions; and “We” emphasizes collaboration and the
    integration of insights from existing designs. Together, this approach
    supports innovative and adaptable problem-solving in developing a
    terrain-capable RoboMaster chassis.

      This section will present the value proposition of the proposed
      step-climbing platform, highlighting how it improves terrain capability,
      strategic flexibility, and long-term competitiveness for the NUS Calibur
      team compared to existing chassis designs.

  <h3 class="subsection-title" id="sec-3-4">3.4 Design Statement</h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Design Statement:</strong>
    “To design a robot that can efficiently climb a 200 mm step within
    2 seconds, effectively traverse all current RoboMaster terrain with a
    speed not less than 1.8 m/s, and incorporate robust, innovative, and
    adaptive design improvements.”
