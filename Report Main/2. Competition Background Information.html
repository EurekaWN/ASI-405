  <h3 class="subsection-title" id="sec-2-1">2.1 Robomaster Competition Specification and Robot Requirements</h3>

  <p>
    For the Standard robot, which is the main strategic unit in a team’s lineup, it serves as the 
    primary combat and mobility platform. It is responsible for mid-range combat, rapid map 
    control, and tactical flexibility, making it the main focus of this project. The objective of this 
    work is to redesign the Standard chassis to include step-climbing capability while maintaining 
    compliance with RoboMaster competition rules.
  </p>

  <!-- EXPANDABLE: KEY PARAMETERS -->
  <details class="expand-box">
    <summary><strong>Click to expand: Key Parameters of the Standard Robot</strong></summary>

    <ul>
      <li>Dimensions: <strong>600 × 600 × 500 mm</strong> (initial), expandable to <strong>800 × 800 × 800 mm</strong></li>
      <li>Maximum weight: <strong>25 kg</strong> (excluding referee system)</li>
      <li>Power capacity: ≤ <strong>300 Wh</strong>, operating voltage ≤ <strong>30 V</strong></li>
      <li>Supercapacitor: ≤ <strong>2200 J</strong> measured energy</li>
      <li>Mobility: High-speed RC or semi-autonomous driving</li>
      <li>Armour/Sensors: 4 armour plates + UWB positioning</li>
      <li>Weapon system: <strong>17 mm launcher</strong> with speed-monitor module</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <p>
    The arena features multi-level platforms divided by trenches, slopes, and most importantly 
    the central <strong>200 mm vertical step</strong> leading to the highland—the most strategically valuable region.
    Although current RMUC rules do not require step-climbing capability, terrain traversal is a 
    major game-changer. Achieving reliable 200 mm step-climbing provides significant tactical 
    advantage while remaining within all mechanical, electrical, and firmware regulations.
  </p>

  <!-- 2.2 STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS -->
  <!-- ========================================================= -->
  <h3 class="subsection-title" id="sec-2-2">2.2 Robomaster Strategical Considerations</h3>

  <p>
    The RoboMaster battlefield rewards positional control, coordinated firepower, and efficient 
    resource usage. Scaling the 200 mm central step grants the <strong>Terrain Cross Buff</strong>, which gives:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>+25% defence bonus</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Up to 5× faster shooting cooldown</strong></li>
    <li>Immediate access to high-value zones</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Standard robots normally access the island using long ramps (Route 3), which delays arrival 
    and increases exposure to enemy fire. A step-climbing platform enables Route 1 access—
    directly scaling the 200 mm obstacle.
  </p>

  <p>This provides:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Speed Advantage</strong>: Shortest path to high-value positions</li>
    <li><strong>Strategic Redundancy</strong>: Alternative routes if ramps are blocked</li>
    <li><strong>Psychological Impact</strong>: Unexpected mobility disrupts enemy planning</li>
    <li><strong>Autonomous Path Planning</strong>: Unlocks AI-driven navigation options</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Therefore, integrating step-climbing ability directly supports the team’s strategy of 
    aggressive mid-map control and high-ground dominance.
  </p>

  <h3 class="subsection-title" id="sec-2-3">2.3 Prediction of Future Rules</h3>

  <p>
    This project considers not only current strategic requirements but also the evolving trend of 
    RoboMaster rules. Anticipating these developments provides a forward-looking advantage in 
    adaptability and competitiveness.
  </p>



  <!-- 2.3.1 Map Trend -->
  <h4 class="subsubsection-title" id="sec-2-3-1">2.3.1 Robomaster Competition Map Evolving Trend</h4>

  <p>
    Recent RoboMaster competitions show a clear shift toward more mobility-demanding terrain:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>2024</strong>: Mild bumpy road → focus on suspension & vibration control.</li>
    <li><strong>2025</strong>: Major changes: <strong>200 mm</strong> and <strong>100 mm steps</strong>, “Terrain Cross” buff.</li>
    <li><strong>2026</strong> (released Oct 2025): Introduced <strong>40 mm-deep wave terrain</strong>, eliminating flat paths entirely.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These updates highlight the growing emphasis on terrain adaptability, reinforcing the need 
    for multi-terrain robot platforms in future competitions.
  </p>



  <!-- 2.3.2 GLOBAL TREND (EXPANDABLE) -->
  <details class="expand-box" id="sec-2-3-2">
    <summary class="subsubsection-title"><strong>2.3.2 Global Trend of All-Terrain Robots (click to expand)</strong></summary>

    <p>
      All-terrain robotics has evolved significantly since early research platforms such as RHex 
      (1998). Commercial adoption accelerated after 2010 with applications in defence, mining, 
      inspection, and agriculture. Global demand increased rapidly from 2020 onwards, with 
      market studies projecting strong growth into the 2030s.
    </p>

    <p>
      The development of this step-climbing RoboMaster Standard robot aligns with these trends, 
      combining competition needs, global robotics movement, and evolving RMUC terrain design. 
      The result is a forward-leaning platform that remains adaptable to future rule changes and 
      new terrain challenges.

    <summary class="subsection-title"><strong>2.4 Current Calibur Team Robot Line Up (click to expand)</strong></summary>

    <p>
      Although the current NUS Calibur lineup performs strongly on flat terrain, the robots 
      struggle with 200 mm steps and wave-like terrain, limiting route options and mid-map 
      control capability.
    </p>

    <p>
      A step-climbing standard unit directly addresses these limitations and positions the team 
      for future terrain-focused rule changes.
