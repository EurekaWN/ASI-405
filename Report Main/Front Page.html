RoboMaster is an international robotics competition founded by DJI that blends engineering innovation with team-based tactical combat. Two teams battle using custom-built robots—such as infantry, hero, engineer, and aerial units—that shoot projectiles and register hits through onboard armor sensors. Victory depends on mobility, positioning, resource control, and ultimately destroying the opponent’s base.

This project focuses on developing a RoboMaster-compliant robot chassis capable of reliably climbing a 200 mm step and traversing complex terrain. Such capability provides strategic advantages by enabling faster access to elevated zones, bypassing chokepoints, and securing superior firing positions. The design prioritizes terrain performance without compromising core metrics such as stability, agility, or shooting accuracy, while adhering to current competition rules and anticipating future updates.

The work encompasses the full development cycle of a RoboMaster combat robot, including mechanical design, prototyping, structural validation, fabrication, electrical and firmware integration, and ultimately kinematic and dynamic motion control.
