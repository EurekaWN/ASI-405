  <h2 class="section-title">4. Design Thinking Process</h2>

  <p>
    This section documents the overall design thinking process used to arrive
    at the final bipedal wheel-leg robot concept. Rather than jumping directly
    into a single solution, multiple design directions were explored,
    evaluated, and iteratively refined using design specifications, literature
    review, morphological charts, and quantitative analysis of key locomotion
    concepts.

  <!-- 4.2 LITERATURE REVIEW -->
  <!-- ========================================================= -->
  <h3 class="subsection-title" id="sec-4-2">4.2 Literature Review of the Past Designs</h3>

  <p>
    This subsection reviews relevant climbing and all-terrain robot designs
    from both research literature and existing RoboMaster robots. The goal is
    to understand the strengths and limitations of different locomotion
    strategies—continuous tracks, articulated legs, wheel-leg hybrids, and
    transformable wheels—and how they influence step-climbing and terrain
    adaptability.
  </p>

  <details class="expand-box">
    <summary><strong>Click to expand: Summary of reviewed design families</strong></summary>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tracked robots</strong> – excellent terrain contact and stability, but higher
          mechanical complexity, higher internal losses, and potential speed penalties.</li>
      <li><strong>Legged robots</strong> – high adaptability and obstacle negotiation, but require
          sophisticated control and often sacrifice top speed and robustness.</li>
      <li><strong>Wheel-leg hybrids</strong> – combine rolling efficiency with active step-climbing
          through leg motion, offering a promising balance for RoboMaster applications.</li>
      <li><strong>Planetary and transformable wheels</strong> – mechanically clever and capable of
          large effective radii, but often complex to design and maintain.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Insights from these designs directly inform which concepts are shortlisted
      for further analysis in the morphological chart and subsequent design
      sense-making steps.

  <!-- 4.3 MORPHOLOGICAL CHART -->
  <!-- ========================================================= -->
  <h3 class="subsection-title" id="sec-4-3">4.3 Morphological Chart</h3>

  <p>
    To systematically explore the design space, a morphological chart is used
    to decompose the robot into key functional blocks (locomotion type, step
    strategy, suspension concept, wheel geometry, etc.) and to generate
    multiple concept combinations. Each concept is scored against weighted
    performance criteria such as flat-ground speed, step-climbing capability,
    stability, power consumption, and mechanical complexity.
  </p>

  <p>
    The interactive morphological gallery embedded in this report allows each
    concept to be visualised and compared dynamically. Hovering over a design
    reveals its parameter scores and a short description, making the trade-offs
    between concepts more intuitive.

  <!-- 4.4 DESIGN SENSE MAKING – CONTINUOUS TRACK -->
  <!-- ========================================================= -->
  <h3 class="subsection-title" id="sec-4-4">4.4 Design Sense Making – Continuous Track</h3>

  <p>
    Continuous tracks are a natural candidate for all-terrain RoboMaster
    robots because of their large contact area and ability to maintain traction
    over uneven ground. In this project, a tracked configuration was analysed
    in detail to evaluate whether it could meet the required 200 mm step
    performance while staying within speed, power, and weight constraints.
  </p>

  <p>
    The analysis included rolling resistance, internal track losses, and
    available motor torque, which together determine the achievable robot
    speed and climbing capability.
  </p>

  <!-- 4.4.1 Continuous Track Speed Calculation -->
  <h4 class="subsubsection-title" id="sec-4-4-1">4.4.1 Continuous Track Speed Calculation</h4>

  <details class="expand-box">
    <summary><strong>Click to expand: Track speed and power calculations</strong></summary>

    <p>
      This subsection documents the estimation of the track-driven robot speed
      based on motor characteristics, gear ratios, and rolling resistance
      coefficients. The key steps include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Estimating <strong>rolling resistance (C<sub>roll</sub>)</strong> and internal losses in the
          undercarriage.</li>
      <li>Computing maximum tractive effort from motor torque and sprocket radius.</li>
      <li>Relating available thrust to steady-state speed on flat ground.</li>
      <li>Checking whether the resulting speed and acceleration meet competition needs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The results show that, although a tracked design offers strong terrain
      capability, the penalty in internal losses and mechanical complexity makes
      it less attractive compared to lighter wheel-leg and linkage-based
      solutions for this specific RoboMaster task.

  <!-- 4.5 WHEEL-LEG HOLONOMIC ANALYSIS -->
  <!-- ========================================================= -->
  <h3 class="subsection-title" id="sec-4-5">4.5 Wheel Leg Holonomic Analysis</h3>

  <p>
    After evaluating the continuous track design, attention is shifted to
    wheel-leg locomotion. This subsection analyses the kinematics and mobility
    characteristics of wheel-leg concepts, including whether they behave as
    holonomic or non-holonomic systems and how that affects battlefield
    manoeuvrability.
  </p>

  <details class="expand-box">
    <summary><strong>Click to expand: Overview of wheel-leg mobility analysis</strong></summary>

    <p>
      The analysis examines:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Feasible motion directions when the legs are in ground-contact phase.</li>
      <li>Turning radius and pivoting behaviour during step-climbing.</li>
      <li>Impact of leg geometry on stability and gimbal aiming performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These insights help filter out purely holonomic but mechanically fragile
      designs in favour of robust non-holonomic variants that still provide
      adequate manoeuvrability for RoboMaster gameplay.

  <!-- 4.6 LINKAGE DESIGN ANALYSIS -->
  <!-- ========================================================= -->
  <h3 class="subsection-title" id="sec-4-6">4.6 Linkage Design Analysis (Bipedal with Linkage)</h3>

  <p>
    The bipedal concept with linkages is then studied as a candidate that can
    amplify torque and enable controlled step-climbing without overloading the
    actuators. The linkage geometry is tuned to provide favourable mechanical
    advantage near the step while maintaining a compact configuration during
    normal driving.
  </p>

  <details class="expand-box">
    <summary><strong>Click to expand: Linkage configuration and torque amplification</strong></summary>

    <p>
      The analysis focuses on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mapping motor torque to ground reaction forces through the linkage.</li>
      <li>Identifying singular configurations and unstable regions.</li>
      <li>Ensuring that the robot can support its own weight when quasi-static
          on the step edge.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These results justify using a linkage-based bipedal architecture over
      simpler wheel-only designs for reliable 200 mm step-climbing.

  <!-- 4.7 BIG WHEEL DESIGN ANALYSIS -->
  <!-- ========================================================= -->
  <h3 class="subsection-title" id="sec-4-7">4.7 Big Wheel Design Analysis</h3>

  <p>
    A big-wheel concept is also evaluated, where the robot attempts to clear
    the step primarily through a large effective wheel radius and controlled
    “hopping” or rolling motion onto the riser. This approach is attractive
    because it can simplify the mechanism, but it places strict requirements on
    wheel size, centre-of-mass position, and available motor power.
  </p>

  <details class="expand-box">
    <summary><strong>Click to expand: Step-climbing and hopping feasibility</strong></summary>

    <p>
      The study includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Geometric conditions for the wheel to contact and roll over a 200 mm step.</li>
      <li>Required vertical and horizontal velocities for smooth “hop” motions.</li>
      <li>Checking whether the launch speed is achievable within motor torque and
          power limits.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The analysis shows that while large wheels can theoretically climb the
      step, the associated compromises in packaging, weight distribution, and
      game layout make this option less favourable than the final bipedal
      wheel-leg linkage design.

  <!-- 4.8 DESIGN ANALYSIS SUMMARY -->
  <!-- ========================================================= -->
  <h3 class="subsection-title" id="sec-4-8">4.8 Design Analysis Summary</h3>

  <p>
    The analyses in Sections 4.4–4.7 are summarised by comparing each concept
    against the weighted design criteria. Continuous tracks, big wheels, and
    alternative wheel-leg configurations are systematically eliminated in favour
    of a bipedal wheel-leg design with linkage-driven step-climbing.
  </p>

  <details class="expand-box">
    <summary><strong>Click to expand: Shortlisted concept rationale</strong></summary>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Continuous track</strong>: strong terrain capability, but higher loss,
          complexity, and packaging challenges.</li>
      <li><strong>Pure big wheel</strong>: geometrically feasible but bulky and less compatible
          with RoboMaster chassis constraints.</li>
      <li><strong>Bipedal wheel-leg with linkage</strong>: good compromise between step-climbing
          performance, agility, and structural robustness.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This leads to the selection of the bipedal wheel-leg robot as the main
      candidate for detailed design and prototyping in the next section.

  <!-- 4.9 INITIAL DESIGN CONCEPT -->
  <!-- ========================================================= -->
  <h3 class="subsection-title" id="sec-4-9">4.9 Initial Design Concept</h3>

  <p>
    Based on the design thinking process and comparative analyses, an initial
    bipedal wheel-leg concept is proposed. The robot uses a pair of actuated
    wheel-legs that can perform both high-speed rolling on flat terrain and
    controlled stepping motions over 200 mm obstacles.
  </p>

  <p>
    This initial concept provides the foundation for the detailed CAD design,
    structural validation, and prototyping described in
    <strong>Section 5: Finalised Main Design Concept Validation and Prototyping</strong>.
