  <h2 class="section-title">3. Problem Clarification</h2>

  <p>
    To guide the design process, a clear direction is required in the form of a
    problem clarification statement, supported by measurable criteria outlined
    in a design statement. Therefore, a competitor analysis is carried out
    first to determine the appropriate design framework to use.

  <!-- 3.1 COMPETITOR ANALYSIS -->
  <!-- ========================================================= -->
  <h3 class="subsection-title" id="sec-3-1">3.1 Competitor Analysis</h3>

  <p>
    The primary competitors in the RoboMaster University Championship (RMUC)
    are international teams, predominantly from top Chinese universities.
    Many of these teams have already developed robots with advanced
    terrain-crossing capabilities.
  </p>

  <p>
    The purpose of the competitor analysis in this project is not to simply
    replicate their designs—a strategy that has traditionally guided the NUS
    RoboMaster team—but to critically evaluate their strengths and limitations.
    By doing so, the goal is to develop a robot that surpasses existing
    solutions through better adaptability and innovative mechanical design.

  <!-- 3.2 HOW MIGHT WE DESIGN FRAMEWORK -->
  <!-- ========================================================= -->
  <h3 class="subsection-title" id="sec-3-2">3.2 How Might We Design Framework</h3>

  <p>
    The guiding question for this project is framed using the “How Might We”
    (HMW) design framework:
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>
      “How might we engineer a robot platform that can adapt to future
      RoboMaster terrain challenges, maintain efficient elevation-climbing
      capability, and incorporate innovative design strategies that maintain
      competitiveness in game for the Calibur team?”
    </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    The HMW framework is adopted because it encourages open and collaborative
    exploration of design possibilities. <br><br>“How” reflects the pursuit of a better,
    future-ready robot; <br>“Might” keeps the process flexible and open to
    unconventional solutions; and <br>“We” emphasizes collaboration and the
    integration of insights from existing designs. <br><br>In the context of 
    RoboMaster—where teams worldwide constantly innovate and new mechanisms appear 
    every season—the HMW approach is especially fitting. Because this is a competitive 
    design environment with many existing reference solutions, the team must remain 
    exploratory, and willing to challenge conventional approaches in order to achieve meaningful 
    advancement. The HMW framework supports this mindset by promoting curiosity, creativity, 
    and the freedom to pursue better alternatives rather than settling on existing designs

  <!-- 3.3 VALUE PROPOSITION -->
  <!-- ========================================================= -->
  <h3 class="subsection-title" id="sec-3-3">3.3 Value Proposition</h3>
<p>
      This section will present the value proposition of the proposed
      step-climbing platform, highlighting how it is significant to the team.
    </p>
  <details class="expand-box">
    <summary><strong>Click to expand: Value proposition overview</strong></summary>
 
  <img src="images/image24.png" alt="Prototype Photo" style="width: 100%; display:block; margin:auto;">
<p style="text-align:center; margin-top:6px;">
  <strong>Figure X:</strong> Explanation put here.
</p>
<p>
  This value proposition overview illustrates how the proposed step-climbing RoboMaster Standard robot delivers meaningful benefits while addressing existing pain points in competitive robot development. On the <strong>Products &amp; Services</strong> side, the project provides a <strong>fully functioning step-climbing chassis</strong>, complete with firmware and control, as well as a <strong>wheel-leg mechanism</strong> capable of efficient stepping and jumping. These features enable the robot to cover more challenging terrain and support future competition maps with increasing mobility demands. The platform is intentionally designed to be <strong>adaptive</strong>, ensuring it continues performing even as terrain complexity increases in upcoming seasons.
</p>

<p>
  On the <strong>Gains</strong> side, the robot offers significant competitive advantages by enabling teams to reach elevated zones faster and exploit terrain-based buffs. The <strong>validated design</strong> also forms a strong foundation for future upgrades, reducing the time needed to iterate for new competition rules. For <strong>Customer Jobs</strong>, this approach minimizes the effort required for annual robot modifications, as only minor mechanical or software adaptations are needed when rules change. Meanwhile, the <strong>Pain Relievers</strong> highlight how the design helps teams cope with rapid, unpredictable RoboMaster rule updates—allowing fast adaptation and reducing the pressure to rebuild “rule-specific” robots every year.
</p>

<p>
  Overall, this value proposition demonstrates that the proposed step-climbing robot is not only a solution to current terrain challenges but also a <strong>future-ready, competition-advantageous platform</strong> that reduces development burden, improves long-term performance consistency, and strengthens NUS Calibur’s ability to respond quickly to evolving RoboMaster rules.
