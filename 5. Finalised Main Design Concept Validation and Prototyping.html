  <!-- 5.2 LINKAGE DESIGN AND CALCULATION -->
  <!-- ========================================================= -->
  <h3 class="subsection-title" id="sec-5-2">5.2 Linkage Detailed Design</h3>
<p>
In this section, the detailed design of the linkage mechanism used in the wheel-leg configuration is presented. 
The linkage is critical for enabling effective step-climbing capability while optimising torque transmission and structural integrity.
</p>





  <!-- 5.2.1 -->
  <h4 class="subsubsection-title" id="sec-5-2-1">5.2.1 Design Consideration</h4>

  <p>
    The linkage is used to create a <strong>torque step-up</strong> based on the ratio between the
    linkage arms (for example, segments CD and CE in the design). A scissor-type five-bar
    configuration is adopted because it offers a much wider tuning range for this ratio compared
    to conventional linkages mounted behind the wheel, which only provide limited
    mechanical amplification.
  </p>

  <p>
    By adjusting pivot positions and arm lengths, the scissor layout allows a higher and more
    controllable torque multiplier specifically in the step-climbing posture. This produces a
    stronger lifting moment at the wheel–step contact while keeping linkage forces within
    realistic material limits. At this stage, the design mainly targets <strong>static load-carrying
    capability</strong> to ensure the robot can hold its weight on a step without back-driving.
  </p>




  <!-- 5.2.2 -->
  <h4 class="subsubsection-title" id="sec-5-2-2">5.2.2 Design Validation</h4>

  <p>
    At this stage, validation focuses on the linkage’s <strong>static load capacity</strong> under the
    motor’s holding torque. The objective is to confirm that, in a step-climbing
    posture, the linkage can safely support the full robot weight with a comfortable
    safety margin.
  </p>

</details>



  <p>
    From the calculation results, many configurations satisfy the 200&nbsp;mm step requirement
    while delivering a static lift capacity exceeding approximately <strong>38&nbsp;kg</strong>, which gives a
    robust safety margin for the current <strong>20&nbsp;kg</strong> robot. These static approximations provide
    a sufficiently conservative reference during the rapid prototyping phase. 

    <br><br>
    For this project, a ratio of  <strong>cd/ce = 115/75 ≈ 1.5</strong> was selected for design and packaging convenience.

</p>

<p> 
The linkage allows a maximum travel of 448 - 137 = 311mm, which is 
sufficient for the robot to climb the 200mm step while maintaining a reasonable posture.

  <p>
    A first prototype of the linkage was manufactured using 3D print plate and standard
    fasteners to quickly verify motion and interference clearance. This
    prototype focuses on:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Checking the real motion envelope against the CAD model.</li>
    <li>Confirming there is no collision with the wheel, chassis or armour.</li>
    <li>Varify the dynamic capability.</li>

  <!-- 5.3.1 -->
  <h4 class="subsubsection-title" id="sec-5-3-1">5.3.1 Design Consideration</h4>

 <p>
  Although many robots stack hip and knee motors using hollow-shaft actuators for compactness, 
  hollow-shaft units are far more expensive. The HT8101 motors used in this project cost about 
  $300 SGD each, whereas comparable hollow-core motors are typically several times more.
  <br><br>
  Using non-hollow motors also enables mounting one at the front and one at the rear of the 
  chassis, improving mass distribution and reducing the load concentration that occurs when 
  stacked motors sit at a single joint.
  <br><br>
  To realise this layout, a cascaded-joint architecture is adopted. This design allows two 
  freely rotating gears to share the same axle, each driving the large and small leg segments 
  independently, as demonstrated in the video.
</p>


  <!-- 5.3.2 -->
  <h4 class="subsubsection-title" id="sec-5-3-2">5.3.2 Design Details</h4>

<p style="text-align:center; margin-top:6px;">
    <strong>Figure X:</strong> Sectioned view of the cascaded joint assembly showing key components and tolerances. 
</p>


  <p>
    The cascaded joint comprises:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Two drive stages using chains and sprockets to route torque to the big and small leg segments.</li>
    <li>A central support structure that houses the 4 headset bearing and chain paths.</li>
    <li>Carefully controlled fabrication tolerances to minimise backlash and misalignment.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Fabrication tolerance is critical: too much clearance introduces backlash and vibration,
    while too little makes assembly difficult. The joint geometry is therefore designed with
    explicit allowance for machining and anodising while keeping functional fits tight in
    high-load regions.
  </p>

<p style="text-align:center; margin-top:6px;">
    <strong>Figure X:</strong> headset bearing.
</p>    

  <p>
    The main joint bearing is a <strong>1.8″ bicycle headset angular-contact bearing</strong> with nominal
    size <strong>47.8 × 56.8 × 6.5&nbsp;mm (ACB568H6.5-type)</strong>, chosen primarily for its compact
    form factor and convenient integration with circular housings.
  </p>


  <!-- 5.3.3 -->
  <h4 class="subsubsection-title" id="sec-5-3-3">5.3.3 Design Validation</h4>

  <p>
    Although the exact load rating of the 47.8 × 56.8 × 6.5&nbsp;mm ACB568H6.5 headset bearing
    is not published by the vendor, a comparable headset bearing (Enduro ACB&nbsp;4545&nbsp;150,
    40&nbsp;×&nbsp;52&nbsp;×&nbsp;7&nbsp;mm) has a static load rating of approximately <strong>4.34&nbsp;kN</strong>.
    the headset bearing is considered significantly over-specified for this application.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a result, the bearing choice is driven almost purely by geometric constraints and
    packaging rather than by ultimate load capacity.
  </p>

    A metal prototype of the cascaded joint was manufactured and assembled with the

  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Smooth rotational motion over the full operating range.</li>
    <li>Acceptable backlash for the current stage of development.</li>

    The Cascaded Joint works as intended and quite smoothly with undetectable vibration and noise. No future improvements are needed.

  <!-- 5.4 HUBLESS WHEEL DESIGN -->
  <!-- ========================================================= -->
  <h3 class="subsection-title" id="sec-5-4">5.4 Hubless Wheel Design</h3>

    <strong>Figure X:</strong> Explanation put here.    
</p>

  <!-- 5.4.1 -->
  <h4 class="subsubsection-title" id="sec-5-4-1">5.4.1 Design Consideration</h4>

<p>
The hubless wheel design was chosen due to RoboMaster competition rules,
 which require rigid “armour plates” to be mounted on all four sides of the robot. 
 These plates must remain at a fixed height and stay horizontally aligned relative to the chassis during motion.

 <br><br>

This constraint makes it difficult to use large conventional wheels in a bipedal wheel-leg configuration, 
as the armour plates would significantly obstruct the leg’s movement(Refer to Figure X (Right). A hubless wheel avoids this interference, 
allowing the leg to articulate freely while still meeting the competition’s armour-mounting requirements.
</p> 

<img src="images/rule.jpg" alt="Prototype Photo" style="width: 80%; display:block; margin:auto;">
<p style="text-align:center; margin-top:6px;">
    <strong>Figure X:</strong> Explanation put here.    
</p>

  <p>
  Given the design constraints, a hubless wheel configuration was selected. Although uncommon due 
  to higher bearing friction, reduced structural rigidity, and the need for a fully customised 
  wheel–hub interface, the design offers a key advantage: it allows a significantly lower chassis 
  profile. This provides much greater flexibility for integrating the gimbal within competition 
  height limits and, importantly, enables the armour plate to be mounted rigidly at the centre of 
  the wheel’s non-rotating inner frame.
</p>


  <!-- 5.4.2 -->
  <h4 class="subsubsection-title" id="sec-5-4-2">5.4.2 Design Details</h4>

 

  <p>
    The current design uses a large turntable bearing as the inner raceway, with a
    3D-printed gear profile attached to the wheel rim for prototyping. The inner non-rotating
    frame mounts directly to the cascaded leg joint, and the outer ring acts as the driven
    wheel. (Refer to Figure X)
  </p>

  <!-- 5.4.3 -->
  <h4 class="subsubsection-title" id="sec-5-4-3">5.4.3 Design Validation</h4>

  <p>
    Kinematic calculations were carried out using the selected motor (e.g. M3508) and gear
    ratio to ensure that the hubless wheel can deliver sufficient tangential speed and
    acceleration on flat ground and during step climbing. These checks confirm that the
    prototype meets the required speed range while staying within realistic torque limits using the available motor.

  <p>
    Due to time constraints, the hubless wheel prototype was built using a
    <strong>350&nbsp;mm-diameter turntable</strong> and a 3D-printed gear profile. This is not a production-grade
    solution, but it is sufficient to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Verify the feasibility of the hubless geometry.</li>
    <li>Test smooth rotational motion under light load.</li>
    <li>Check assembly and integration with the leg structure.</li>
  </ul>



  <!-- 5.4.5 -->
  <h4 class="subsubsection-title" id="sec-5-4-5">5.4.5 Future Improvements</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Replace the temporary turntable with a bearing specifically designed for radial loads.
      The current turntable risks ball jamming under high radial forces.
    </li>
    <li>
      Perform dynamic modelling of the gear train to determine the optimal gear ratio with
      respect to the motor torque and desired speed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Simplify and stiffen the mounting structure between the inner frame and the leg;
      several intermediate pieces are currently used only to “fit” the wheel-leg assembly and
      can be eliminated.
    </li>
    <li>
      Increase overall structural rigidity to reduce flex, which would otherwise degrade
      control performance.

  <p>
    The chain drive is used to offset the drive motor to the side of the leg while still
    transmitting torque to the hubless wheel and cascaded joints. This improves packaging
    flexibility and keeps the motor away from direct impact zones.
  </p>

</p>


  <p>
    A lightweight bicycle-type chain is selected rather than a standard industrial roller chain,
    in order to reduce mass and inertia at the leg. Sprocket sizes are chosen to achieve the
    required overall gear ratio when combined with the motor’s internal reduction.
  </p>


  <!-- 5.5.2 -->
  <h4 class="subsubsection-title" id="sec-5-5-2">5.5.2 Design Details</h4>

  <p>
    The chain drive consists of:

    <li>Driven sprocket on the hubless wheel / intermediate shaft.</li>
    <li>A small roller acting as a chain tensioner.</li>

  <p>
    Implement a <strong>screw-adjustable tensioning mechanism</strong> so that chain tension can be
    tuned precisely during assembly and maintenance. The mounting brackets for both the
    tensioner and the sprockets should be stiffened and simplified to minimise play, which
    will improve drivetrain efficiency and reduce backlash.
