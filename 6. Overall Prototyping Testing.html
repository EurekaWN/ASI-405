  This video demonstrated that the reaction of the hubless wheel is 
  satisfactory when the PID control algorithm is implemented to react to robot position changes.

    This video demonstrated that the joint motor isinitiated and it hold the robot leg in position
    with the chain drive mechanism and MIT PID Controller when the robot is balancing on wheel's PID.
    This shows the cohesiveness of the overall design of the robot.

  This video demostrated when the robot is travelling on wave like obstacles with a depth of 40mm, 
  due to the big wheel advantage in terrain passing, the robot wheel is measured to only have a displacement in 
  height of 15mm, showcasing the robot's capability to handle difficult terrain.

This video demonstrate the motion feasibility of the robot when climbing a 200mm step with the "laying on top"
method.

  <h3 class="subsection-title" id="sec-6-2">6.2 Prototyping Summary</h3>


  <ul>
  <li>Successful proof of concept for the wheel-leg mechanism, validating the fundamental motion principles.</li>
  <li>Functional hubless wheel with integrated wheel-leg structure.</li>
  <li>Feasible and mechanically consistent linkage geometry.</li>
  <li>Reliable initial mechanical motion performance.</li>
  <li>Step-climbing and jumping motions partially validated through manual testing (control algorithm not yet implemented).</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Overall, the prototype confirms the feasibility of the proposed design. While several refinements 
  and minor redesigns are still required, the project will continue forward based on this validated 
  configuration.
